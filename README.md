#Bubbles
######August 2015 - Present day

Bubbles is my latest project. It originally started as an idea of jumping up bubbles in a verticle path, but than became more like a platformer now highly inspired by the game Limbo. I'm trying to be very careful with everything I add to the game because my goal is to make it look as professional and polished as possible. This is my first project where I am using openAL for sounds and right now I am spending a lot of time learning how to create sounds and music. The music I'm working on for the game is entirely inspired by Disasterpeace, who made the music for the game Fez. In terms of programming, my problem right now is how to create a practical level editor without getting incredibly bored, because I have all of the assets I want for the first part of the game. For right now, I can add planets by left clicking as I play the game, and eventually I'm going to save those to a file. But I still am going to need a much more reasonable editor in the future.
